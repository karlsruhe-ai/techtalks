# Probabilistic weather prediction: From ensembles to neural networks

**31. January 2018**

Nowadays, weather forecasts are often given in the form of forecast ensembles
obtained from multiple runs of numerical weather prediction models with varying
initial conditions and model physics. Such ensemble predictions typically tend
to be biased and lack calibration, and thus require some form of statistical
post-processing. Using forecast-observation pairs from the past to identify
model errors and adjust the current forecast accordingly, statistical
post-processing allows to correctly represent and quantify the associated
prediction uncertainty in order to provide calibrated and sharp predictive
distributions, a prerequisite for optimal decision making in many applications.
This talk will review recent developments and active areas of research in
statistical post-processing of ensemble forecasts spanning from classical
distributional regression methods to first attempts of using neural network
approaches.

This talk was given by Sebastian Lerch. Sebastian is a Postdoc at the Institute
for Stochastics of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), and a member of
the Computational Statistics group at the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical
Studies (HITS).
